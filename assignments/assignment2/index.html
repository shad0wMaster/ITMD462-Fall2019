      <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
      <p>I am Andy Jakub Kukuc. I am a 4th year Undergraduate Student at Illinois Institute of Technology. I am a double major in Computer Science and Information Technology Management. I have three hobbies and the first one I love working on my car. I have a 2009 Shelby GT 500. I put a lot of time and money into making it a very unique car. Whenever I am not programming or designing UX/UI applications I am in my garage working on "King Cobra". Also I love to wear suits so here is a picture of me in a suit next to my car. No I don't work on my car in a suit HAHAHAHAH.</p>

      <h2>Mountain Biking</h2>
      <img src="images/bike.JPG" alt="bike"/>
      <p>My second hobby is mountain biking. Ever since I was little I always rode my bike everywhere. As I got my license I completely forgot about riding a bike and started to miss out on the fresh air and the wind blowing through my hair. Over summer I bought a bike from my old Kickboxing Trainer and already put about 200 miles on it. I wake up every day at 5am and ride my bike about 10 miles. I like to stay in shape but after a couple powerlifitng injuries I can't really strength train anymore. That is why one of my top hobbies is mountain biking!</p>

      <h2>Computer Building</h2>
      <img src="images/comp.JPG" alt="comp"/>
      <p>My third and final hobby is building computers. The photo attached is one of my recent builds. I started building computers and servers when I was a sophomore in high school. Through out my life I built approximately 200 computers for all my clients. The computers that I built all range from light office work to heavy duty mining servers. Computer Building will be one of my hobbies that I will pass on to my children in the future. If you need a computer built come to me and I will help you build it!
